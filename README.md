# Developmental Transitions
The Developmental Transitions model of dynamics of cognitive vulnerability and family support is a “proof of concept” model where the primary purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility of using system dynamics to develop feedback theories in developmental psychology. As such, the primary criterion for a good model is whether or not the model successfully illustrates how system dynamics could be used to develop feedback theories. 

The model was developed using isee Stella Architect (version 2.1) to develop an interactive interface that can be shared online via isee Exchange and analyze the influence of loops using loop scores. Loop scores are a recent innovation for measure the impact of a feedback mechanism on the overall dynamic behavior of a system. 

# Data
Data supporting the model came from a secondary analysis of qualitative interviews exploring suicidal behaviors among adolescent in low-income families in New York City. Participants in the qualitative phase of the larger study included 73 Latinas aged 11 to 19 who had self-harmed within six months prior to the interview and 66 Latina adolescents with no reported lifetime history of self-harm. IRB approval was granted at all institutions involved in project activities, and each participant (adolescents and their caregivers) provided assent and consent to participate in the study.
